# Build Your Own Version

I write a tool (check out the `build/` folder) to optimize the process. It will __programmatically__: 

1. Fetch the problem list from LeetCode OJ and save in `build/leetcode.html`

2. Check out the local solutions (Pls save the code as `123. Some Problem/whatever-you-like.js`)

3. Update the README file

Try it: Just clone the repo and run

    npm install && npm run build

Be free to contact to discuss about this simple tool.
